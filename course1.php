									<p><!--[--><strong>Basic programming</strong> is learning that provides the basics of logic that are universal and precipitates the formation of one's mindset about making an effective and efficient program. So these universal principles can be applied to any programming language, anytime, anywhere.<!--]--></p>

									<h2 class="major">Programming Basic Concepts</h2>
									<p>Programming is the activity of giving commands to computers to perform certain tasks using a programming language. The programming language itself is the instructions that are understood by the computer to perform certain tasks. Collection of tasks that can be performed by the computer will then be a program or software.</p>
									<p>Software is a guide of instructions written in the form of codes using a certain programming language and has been compiled using the appropriate compiler (Raharjo in Yulia, 2015, p. 28). For the record, actually not all programs have to compile.</p>

									<h2 class="major">1. High Level Programming Language</h2>
									<p>As for high-level programming languages, the command structure/syntax is very similar to the sentences used by everyday humans, so it's easy for humans to read and learn in general. Examples of the types of programming languages included in this group are Java, Pascal, Python, C/C++ etc.</p>
									<p>In the industrial environment, almost all software development companies now use frameworks to complete their projects. Frameworks that are widely used to build website-based software are Laravel and CodeIgniter. Meanwhile the Mobile frameworks that are being widely used include React Native and Flutter.</p>

									<h2 class="major">2. Low Level Programming Language</h2>
									<p>Low-level programming languages are programming languages whose syntax is difficult for humans to understand in general. In this case, the structure of the syntax can only be understood by certain people. The types of programming languages included in this group are machine language and assembly programming languages.</p>
