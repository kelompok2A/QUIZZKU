									<p><!--[--><strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong> is a programming paradigm that prioritizes the management and processing of objects from the real world that must be processed by software through its advantages, namely being able to process dynamic objects that can accommodate data along with their complex structures, or certain operations and even algorithms needed to process real world objects.<!--]--></p>

									<h2 class="major">Class and Object</h2>
									<p>Class or class is a blueprint of the object. In OOP the programmer will write the code for each class that will be used. Meanwhile, an object is an instance of a class that runs at runtime. At runtime, the variables in a class will become the state of an object, while the method created will become its behavior.</p>
									<p>In the real world, every existing object has two characteristics, namely state and behavior :</p>
									<p>1. State is an attribute owned by an object.</p>
									<p>2. Behavior is a function that is owned and can be executed by its users.</p>

									<p>Low-level programming languages are programming languages whose syntax is difficult for humans to understand in general. In this case, the structure of the syntax can only be understood by certain people. The types of programming languages included in this group are machine language and assembly programming languages.</p>
